            <div class="introduction">
                <p>My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like
                    every
                    other actor.</p>
                <p>I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known
                    for
                    playing charismatic male leads, and have been described as the world's most attractive man by
                    several
                    media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father figure,
                    which
                    I am
                    to my six children.</p>
                <p>Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company
                    Plan
                    B
                    Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and
                    skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of
                    these
                    interestsâ€”sometimes all three!</p>
